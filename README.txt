Introduction
------------

WavForge is a proof-of-concept class that generates some waveforms and
outputs PCM WAV files. It's also a bit slow, but this is only a proof
of concept demo.

The original version was written in 2004, but WavForge was updated in
2009 with a few more features, PHP 5 support, and cleaner code. However,
the interface has changed significantly.
